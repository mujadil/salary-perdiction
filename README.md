# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict the salary of individuals based on their years of experience using a Linear Regression model. The model is trained on a dataset of experience and salary data. Additionally, the project utilizes Plotly to visualize the relationship between experience and salary.


## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to predict the salary of an individual given their years of experience. This is achieved through the implementation of a Linear Regression model, which is one of the most fundamental and widely used algorithms in supervised machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains two columns:
1. **Years of Experience**: The number of years an individual has worked.
2. **Salary**: The annual salary of the individual.

The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `salary_data.csv`.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `plotly`

You can install these dependencies by running:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn plotly
